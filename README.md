# Udacity-Image-Classifier
Image Classifier Project from Udacity AI programming with Python Nanodegree

# Description
My first project during my AI programming with python Nanodegree.
Project Goal: The models were already trained with the classifiers, my task was to complete the various python files needed to execute the classifier correctly. The focus was on following instructions to complete the python codes needed and less on the classifier.
